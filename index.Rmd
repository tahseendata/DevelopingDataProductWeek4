## Why Should You Know Linear Regression?

* easy to use
* easy to interpret
* applicable for a huge variety of problems
* fairly accurate

$\Rightarrow$ among the most widely used algorithms by data scientists

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4, fig.align = 'center'}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(swiss, aes(Fertility, Infant.Mortality))
p <- p + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "lm")
p <- p + xlab("") + ylab("")
p
```

## Why Should You Know General Linear Models?

* a specific case of GLM's is linear regression with multiple predictors
* lots of problems with discrete outcomes
* error models have to stay interpretable even when the outcome has to be positive

```{r, echo = FALSE}
glm(Infant.Mortality ~ Fertility + Education + Catholic, data = swiss)
```

## How Does The App Help You Understand GLM's?

* no need to learn a language like R
* you can concentrate on the algorithm
* you can play around with different predictors and compare their effects

## How Does The App Help You Explain GLM's?

*** { name : left }

* no need to explain any code syntax
* focus on the interpretation
* explain the effects of in-/exclusion of certain predictors on
  * the model quality
  * the coefficients and their significance
  * the model visualizations
  * the sign of other coefficients (see examples to the right)

*** { name : right }

```{r}
glm (
    Infant.Mortality ~ Fertility
                       + Examination,
    data = swiss
)$coefficients
```

```{r}
glm (
    Infant.Mortality ~ Examination,
    data = swiss
)$coefficients
```
