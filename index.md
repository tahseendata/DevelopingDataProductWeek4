## Why Should You Know Linear Regression?

* easy to use
* easy to interpret
* applicable for a huge variety of problems
* fairly accurate

$\Rightarrow$ among the most widely used algorithms by data scientists


```
## Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 3.2.5

## Why Should You Know General Linear Models?

* a specific case of GLM's is linear regression with multiple predictors
* lots of problems with discrete outcomes
* error models have to stay interpretable even when the outcome has to be positive


```
## 
## Call:  glm(formula = Infant.Mortality ~ Fertility + Education + Catholic, 
##     data = swiss)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)    Fertility    Education     Catholic  
##    7.867371     0.159631     0.103403    -0.006246  
## 
## Degrees of Freedom: 46 Total (i.e. Null);  43 Residual
## Null Deviance:	    390.3 
## Residual Deviance: 298.3 	AIC: 230.2

## How Does The App Help You Understand GLM's?

* no need to learn a language like R
* you can concentrate on the algorithm
* you can play around with different predictors and compare their effects

## How Does The App Help You Explain GLM's?

*** { name : left }

* no need to explain any code syntax
* focus on the interpretation
* explain the effects of in-/exclusion of certain predictors on
  * the model quality
  * the coefficients and their significance
  * the model visualizations
  * the sign of other coefficients (see examples to the right)
